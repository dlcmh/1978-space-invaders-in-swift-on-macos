# Contributing to SPACE INVADERS — Metal Arcade

Thanks for your interest. This is a compact, dependency-free native macOS game,
and focused contributions are welcome.

Before changing anything, read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md),
[Docs/PROJECT_ORIGIN.md](Docs/PROJECT_ORIGIN.md), and
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Prerequisites

- macOS 13 or newer on a Metal-capable Mac
- Xcode or Apple Command Line Tools with Swift
- Git

No package-manager dependencies are required.

## Build and run

```bash
swift build
swift run SpaceInvadersArcade
```

Build the distributable app and disk image:

```bash
make app
make dmg
open "dist/SPACE INVADERS.app"
```

Generated artifacts in `.build/` and `dist/` are deliberately not versioned.

For screenshots and smoke tests, the app understands
`SPACEINVADERS_AUTOSTART=1`, `SPACEINVADERS_AUTOFIRE=1`, and
`SPACEINVADERS_AUTOPAUSE=0`. They are development aids, not player-facing
features. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#build-run-and-verify).

## Verify changes

```bash
make check
```

That runs the full gate: `swift-format lint`, a release build with
`-warnings-as-errors`, the simulation checks, and the documentation checks.
Run it before every commit; the individual stages are also available
(`make checks`, `make docs-check`).

Swift has no Clippy, and this repository stays dependency-free, so the gate uses
only what the Apple Command Line Tools ship: `swift-format` for style and the
compiler's own diagnostics for correctness. Style is defined by
[`.swift-format`](.swift-format) — 4-space indent, 100 columns — and applied
with:

```bash
xcrun swift-format format --in-place --recursive Sources Checks
```

`Sources/SpaceInvadersArcade/MetalShaders.swift` opts out of formatting with
`// swift-format-ignore-file` because its payload is an MSL string literal.

The checks executable is the regression suite. It covers formation dimensions
and point values, cannon rails, firing, collision, bunker damage, pause,
mystery-ship crossing, bomb hits and life loss, game over and restart, a
60-second movement soak test, and an autopilot that clears all 55 invaders and
advances to wave 2. Add checks whenever you change gameplay logic. Use the
public API of `SpaceInvadersGame`; do not add test-only mutation hooks to
production code.

For rendering, input, shader, or windowing changes, launching the app is
mandatory: Metal shaders compile at runtime, so a build alone cannot validate
them.

Documentation links are checked too:

```bash
make docs-check
```

Prose cites a file and a symbol — never a line number — and the checker verifies
that every cited symbol still exists in the linked file. See
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#documentation-and-code-references). After changing code,
`make docs-impact` lists the documents that reference the files you touched.

## Where to make changes

- **Simulation:** `Sources/SpaceInvadersCore/` — Foundation only. Keep it
  independent of AppKit, Metal, MetalKit, and AVFoundation.
- **Presentation and platform:** `Sources/SpaceInvadersArcade/`
- **Checks:** `Checks/main.swift`
- **Packaging:** `scripts/` and `Makefile`
- **User docs:** `README.md`
- **Governance docs:** `AGENTS.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, this file, `SECURITY.md`,
  and `Docs/PROJECT_ORIGIN.md`

## Quality bar

A contribution is ready when:

- `swift build` succeeds without new warnings;
- `swift run SpaceInvadersChecks` passes;
- `make docs-check` passes, and docs affected by the change were re-read;
- rendering changes were visually checked by running the app;
- gameplay invariants documented in `AGENTS.md` still hold, or the change
  explicitly updates them along with the checks and docs;
- no new runtime dependency, telemetry, network access, or non-original asset
  was introduced; and
- user-facing documentation and screenshots are current.

## Style

- Follow the existing Swift formatting and naming.
- Keep functions and types focused; the core should stay readable and testable.
- Prefer value types for state snapshots and explicit commands over public
  mutable state.
- Preserve the fixed-step 60 Hz simulation. Do not make movement or timing
  depend on display refresh rate.
- Keep procedural art and audio procedural. Do not add arcade ROM content,
  ripped sprites, recorded arcade audio, or copyrighted fonts.
- Keep the simulation in original 224 × 256 arcade pixels; the renderer owns
  scaling and presentation.
- Avoid adding dependencies. Discuss a proposed dependency with the maintainer
  before writing code around it.

## Workflow

1. Open an issue for a substantial behavior change or new scope.
2. Branch from `main` using a descriptive name, for example
   `feat/mystery-ship-scoring` or `fix/bunker-erosion`.
3. Make a coherent change with checks and docs.
4. Run the verification above.
5. Commit using a Conventional Commit message:
   - `feat: ...`
   - `fix: ...`
   - `docs: ...`
   - `perf: ...`
   - `refactor: ...`
   - `chore: ...`
6. Open a pull request describing the change, verification performed, and any
   known limitations.

Allowed direct pushes by repository agents are defined in `AGENTS.md`. Human
contributors should use pull requests unless the maintainer says otherwise.

## Reporting bugs

Use the repository issue tracker and include:

- macOS and Swift versions;
- steps to reproduce;
- expected and observed behavior;
- a screenshot or short recording for visual issues; and
- whether the issue reproduces after `make app` and a clean launch.

Please do not include secrets, personal information, or unredacted local paths
in public reports.

## Security

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability. Follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Conduct

Be constructive, specific, and respectful. Harassment, discrimination, personal
attacks, and deliberately disruptive behavior are not welcome. The maintainer
may moderate, close, or block participation to keep the project healthy.
